An idea for how to practice this: in your next team brainstorm, instead of defining all the reasons an idea won’t work, try listing all the reasons it might work.<br>3. <b>Humility & willingness to grow</b>: “Everyone in the world is better than you at something.” The smartest people always know that they’re not the smartest person, and stay open to constructive feedback (from anyone - not just their superiors) as a tool for continuous growth. The humility to receive feedback without becoming defensive or pointing fingers is crucial to YO’s culture. And of course, feedback should always be given following the “Radical Candor” style. (Radical Candor is required reading!) <br>4. <b>World-class communicators</b>: When in doubt, overcommunicate. Imagine how many problems in the world have been caused by miscommunication or misunderstandings caused by less-than-perfect communication. We’ve all been there - you walk away from an interaction thinking that the other person understood you perfectly, yet find out a few days later that they had a completely different takeaway of the conversation as you did. This is especially a challenge for globally distributed teams who work in several different languages and time zones. We are looking to build a team of world-class communicators (whether written or verbal, but ideally both) in order to improve efficiency, productivity, and happiness at YO (less misunderstandings equals happier workplace). (Required reading: The Story of Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody)<br>5. <b>Proactive & problem-solving attitude</b>: Nobody wants to work with somebody who only brings problems to the table and not solutions. We’re looking for people who will lead brainstorms, suggest ways to help their coworkers solve problems, or be willing to roll up their sleeves and jump in if their help/skillset is needed (the “no task too small” attitude). We expect that the first response to a problem is to start finding solutions."
